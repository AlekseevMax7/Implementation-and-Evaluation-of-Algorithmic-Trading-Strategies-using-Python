# Implementation-and-Evaluation-of-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies-using-Python

Type of work: Individual data science project

Summary: This project involved the implementation and evaluation of three algorithmic trading strategies – Mean Reversion (via Bollinger Bands), Trend Following (using Double Moving Average Crossovers), and Statistical Arbitrage (based on return correlations) – applied to stock market data. The strategies were developed using Python and tested through historical backtesting on data retrieved from the CoinGecko API and Yahoo Finance. The primary goal was to assess the profitability, risk, and applicability of these strategies in highly dynamic markets like cryptocurrencies and equities.

Key skills:

•	Time series analysis 

•	Algorithmic trading strategy development

•	Financial indicators

•	Profit & Loss evaluation

•	Correlation modeling & Multivariate relationship analysis

Project results:

•	Effectively implemented the Mean Reversion strategy using Bollinger Bands, enabling timely and accurate trade entries in volatile markets.
 
•	The Trend Following strategy based on 50/100-day moving average crossovers captured directional market movements and generated a strong cumulative return profile.

•	Applied a Statistical Arbitrage approach to TSLA, AMZN, and AAPL, identifying moderately correlated assets and constructing a portfolio that optimized P&L.

•	Demonstrated clear outperformance over buy-and-hold benchmarks.
